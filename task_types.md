Here's a detailed explanation of the four task types in Habitica:

1. **Habits:**
   - **Description:** Habits are actions you want to encourage or discourage that don't have a fixed schedule. They can be positive (good habits you want to build) or negative (bad habits you want to break).
   - **Examples:**
     - Positive Habit: Taking a stretching break.
     - Negative Habit: Chewing your nails.
   - **Mechanics:** You can mark a Habit as completed (+) or not (-) whenever you perform or avoid the action. There's no penalty for not engaging with a Habit, but engaging with it can reward or penalize you based on its nature.

2. **Dailies:**
   - **Description:** Dailies are tasks you want to complete on a regular schedule, such as daily or on specific days of the week. They help build consistent routines.
   - **Examples:**
     - Going to bed on time every day.
     - Doing laundry every Saturday.
   - **Mechanics:** Dailies are scheduled for specific days. If you don't complete a Daily on its scheduled day, you'll lose health points. Completing a Daily rewards you with experience points and gold. ([habitica.fandom.com](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Establishing_Your_Tasks?utm_source=openai))

3. **To Do's:**
   - **Description:** To Do's are one-time or infrequent tasks that you want to accomplish. They don't repeat and are removed from your list once completed.
   - **Examples:**
     - Sending a birthday card to your dad.
     - Picking up a package at the post office.
   - **Mechanics:** To Do's can have due dates but don't penalize you if not completed on time. Completing a To Do rewards you with experience points and gold. ([habitica.fandom.com](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Establishing_Your_Tasks?utm_source=openai))

4. **Rewards:**
   - **Description:** Rewards are treats or indulgences you can purchase using the gold earned from completing tasks. They can be in-game items or custom rewards you define.
   - **Examples:**
     - In-game: Purchasing better armor for your avatar.
     - Real-life: Buying a new book or enjoying a special treat.
   - **Mechanics:** Rewards provide motivation by allowing you to use the gold you've earned to treat yourself, reinforcing positive behavior. ([habitica.fandom.com](https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Establishing_Your_Tasks?utm_source=openai))
